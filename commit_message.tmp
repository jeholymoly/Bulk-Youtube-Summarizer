docs: Finalize and correct installation instructions

- Remove unused audio dependencies (pyaudio, etc.) from all requirements files.
- Update README to remove unnecessary audio-related system prerequisites.
- Clarify the use of `pkg` for base Termux vs. `apt` for `proot-distro`.
- Remove `sudo` from `apt` commands as it's not needed in the `proot` environment.
- Add `-y` flag to installation commands for non-interactive setup.
